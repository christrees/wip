What popped into my head was LLM for healthcare..

- [Clinical Documentation automation](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/7/aws-announces-aws-healthscribe-a-new-generative-ai-powered-service-that-automatically-creates-clinical-documentation)
- [AI in Radiology](https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/news-and-features/how-artificial-intelligence-is-driving-changes-in-radiology/)

All of this requires the LLM model to interface with local data that is not exposed along with all localized ai bias feedback that could be used.
